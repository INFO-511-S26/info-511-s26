> The goal of this assignment is not just to observe data science—but to begin participating in the data science ecosystem as an emerging professional.

The world of data science extends far beyond the classroom.
Professional identity, ethical awareness, technical growth, and community engagement are just as important as coding and modeling.

The **Data Science Experience (DSE)** assignments are designed to:

-   Expose you to **real-world data science practice**

-   Help you **connect classroom learning to industry, research, ethics, and public impact**

-   Build your **professional communication and reflection skills**

-   Create **portfolio-ready artifacts**

You will complete **two Data Science Experiences** this semester:

1.  DSE I (Midterm)

2.  DSE II (End of Term)

📌 You will have separate GitHub repositories assigned for each experience.
📌 No late submissions are accepted.
📌 You may submit anytime before the deadline.

## Global Requirements

You must complete both parts for each DSE:

-   [Part 1: Engage in a qualifying data science experience](#part-1-experience-data-science-outside-of-the-classroom)

-   [Part 2: Produce a professional summary artifact (slides + reflection)](#part-2-summarize-your-experience)

::: callout-important
> You may NOT repeat the same category across DSE I and DSE II.
:::

## Acceptable Category Pairings

You must choose:

-   Two different categories among 1, 2, and 3, OR
